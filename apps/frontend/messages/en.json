    "about": "Kecskemét Guessr is an image recognition game, that you can play alone or with friends. You can play on your computer or phone.\nThe goal of the game is to find where each image was taken from and mark it on the map. The pictures are in select areas of Kecskemét and were taken from Google streetview. The game tries to give you images you haven't seen before\nAs a local I was always curious how well I knew my hometown. With this game you can prove your knowledge and learn more about this beautiful city!\nI am developing the game alone. I am happy to receive ideas, problems or any other feedback on my contact email below.",
    "how_to_play": "Games are made up of rounds. Every round you get a new image. Mark your guess on the map with a tack. After everyone guessed, the answer is revealed and everyone is awarded points based on how far they guessed.\nPerfect guesses are awarded 500 points, for each meter you missed you lose a point. The player with most points wins.\nThe owner of a game can set various rules: time limit, player limit, hint."
